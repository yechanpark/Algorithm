/**
 * You are given an array A consisting of N integers.
 * <p>
 * For each number A[i] such that 0 ≤ i < N, we want to count the number of elements of the array that are not the divisors of A[i]. We say that these elements are non-divisors.
 * <p>
 * For example, consider integer N = 5 and array A such that:
 * <p>
 * A[0] = 3
 * A[1] = 1
 * A[2] = 2
 * A[3] = 3
 * A[4] = 6
 * For the following elements:
 * <p>
 * A[0] = 3, the non-divisors are: 2, 6,
 * A[1] = 1, the non-divisors are: 3, 2, 3, 6,
 * A[2] = 2, the non-divisors are: 3, 3, 6,
 * A[3] = 3, the non-divisors are: 2, 6,
 * A[4] = 6, there aren't any non-divisors.
 * Write a function:
 * <p>
 * class Solution { public int[] solution(int[] A); }
 * <p>
 * that, given an array A consisting of N integers, returns a sequence of integers representing the amount of non-divisors.
 * <p>
 * Result array should be returned as an array of integers.
 * <p>
 * For example, given:
 * <p>
 * A[0] = 3
 * A[1] = 1
 * A[2] = 2
 * A[3] = 3
 * A[4] = 6
 * the function should return [2, 4, 3, 2, 0], as explained above.
 * <p>
 * Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
 * <p>
 * N is an integer within the range [1..50,000];
 * each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..2 * N].
