/**
 * The logic to solve this problem is same as "max subarray problem" using Kadane's Algorithm. Since no body has mentioned this so far, I thought it's a good thing for everybody to know.
 *
 * All the straight forward solution should work, but if the interviewer twists the question slightly by giving the difference array of prices, Ex: for {1, 7, 4, 11}, if he gives {0, 6, -3, 7}, you might end up being confused.
 *
 * Here, the logic is to calculate the difference (maxCur += prices[i] - prices[i-1]) of the original array, and find a contiguous subarray giving maximum profit. If the difference falls below 0, reset it to zero.
 *
 * *maxCur = current maximum value
 * *maxSoFar = maximum value found so far
